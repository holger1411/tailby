**Kirby CMS & Tailwind CSS boilerplate**  
I just add Tailwind CSS to the Kirby Plainkit starter pack. There are no changes at the workflow(s). More coming soon.

## Credits
- **[getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com)** – Flat file PHP CMS.
- **[tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – THE utility first framework.
